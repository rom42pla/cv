ABSTRACT = {During flight, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) need several sensors to follow a predefined path and reach a specific destination. To this aim, they generally exploit an inertial measurement unit (IMU) for pose estimation. Usually, in the UAV context, an IMU entails a three-axis accelerometer and a three-axis gyroscope. However, as happens for many physical devices, they can present some misalignment between the real value and the registered one. These systematic or occasional errors can derive from different sources and could be related to the sensor itself or to external noise due to the place where it is located. Hardware calibration requires special equipment, which is not always available. In any case, even if possible, it can be used to solve the physical problem and sometimes requires removing the sensor from its location, which is not always feasible. At the same time, solving the problem of external noise usually requires software procedures. Moreover, as reported in the literature, even two IMUs from the same brand and the same production chain could produce different measurements under identical conditions. This paper proposes a soft calibration procedure to reduce the misalignment created by systematic errors and noise based on the grayscale or RGB camera built-in on the drone. Based on the transformer neural network architecture trained in a supervised learning fashion on pairs of short videos shot by the UAVâ€™s camera and the correspondent UAV measurements, the strategy does not require any special equipment. It is easily reproducible and could be used to increase the trajectory accuracy of the UAV during the flight.},

ABSTRACT = {The last two decades have seen an incessant growth in the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with HD cameras for developing aerial vision-based systems to support civilian and military tasks, including land monitoring, change detection, and object classification. To perform most of these tasks, the artificial intelligence algorithms usually need to know, a priori, what to look for, identify. or recognize. Actually, in most operational scenarios, such as war zones or post-disaster situations, areas and objects of interest are not decidable a priori since their shape and visual features may have been altered by events or even intentionally disguised (e.g., improvised explosive devices (IEDs)). For these reasons, in recent years, more and more research groups are investigating the design of original anomaly detection methods, which, in short, are focused on detecting samples that differ from the others in terms of visual appearance and occurrences with respect to a given environment. In this paper, we present a novel two-branch Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based method for low-altitude RGB aerial video surveillance to detect and localize anomalies. We have chosen to focus on the low-altitude sequences as we are interested in complex operational scenarios where even a small object or device can represent a reason for danger or attention. The proposed model was tested on the UAV Mosaicking and Change Detection (UMCD) dataset, a one-of-a-kind collection of challenging videos whose sequences were acquired between 6 and 15 m above sea level on three types of ground (i.e., urban, dirt, and countryside). Results demonstrated the effectiveness of the model in terms of Area Under the Receiving Operating Curve (AUROC) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), achieving an average of 97.2% and 95.7%, respectively, thus suggesting that the system can be deployed in real-world applications.},
