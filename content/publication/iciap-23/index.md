abstract: The ability to detect lies is a crucial skill in essential situations like
  police interrogations and court trials. At present, several devices, such as polygraphs
  and magnetic resonance, can ease the deception detection task. However, the effectiveness
  of these tools can be compromised by intentional behavioral changes due to the subject
  awareness of such appliances, suggesting that alternative ways must be explored
  to detect lies without using physical devices. In this context, this paper presents
  an approach focused on the extraction of meaningful features from hand gestures.
  The latter provide cues on the person's behavior and are used to address the deception
  detection task in RGB videos of trials. Specifically, the proposed system extracts
  hands skeletons from an RGB video sequence and generates novel handcrafted features
  from the extrapolated keypoints to reflect the subject behavior through hand movements.
  Then, a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network is used to classify these features
  and estimate whether the person is lying or not. Extensive experiments were performed
  to assess the quality of the derived features on a public collection of famous real-life
  trials. On this dataset, the proposed system sets new state-of-the-art performance
  on the unimodal hand-gesture deception detection task, demonstrating the effectiveness
  of the proposed approach and its handcrafted features.
